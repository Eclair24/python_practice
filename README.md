# Python Practice
A collection of pythonic solutions to standard Data Structures and Algorithms practice problems with a focus on 
clean well-documented code.

The goal of this repo is to serve as a refresher on these basic problems.

## Problems
This section provides a description of the problems available in this repository so far.

### 0/1 Knapsack Problem
_Find the Pythonic Solution [here](knapsack.py)_

**General Knapsack Problem:**
    Given a list of items (having some weight and value) and a knapsack with a fixed capacity, the problem is to try to
    obtain the most valuable items without going over the knapsack weight limit.

**Our Specific Knapsack Problem:**
    We use calories instead of weight, the context of the problem is: You are at a restaurant trying to eat the best
    food that you can without going over your daily allotted calorie limit.
